      <h2 class="content__img-card__title--box-1">PLOT</h2>
      <p class="content__img-card__text--box-1">16-year-old Cady Heron has spent the past 12 years living in Africa homeschooled by her zoologist parents. Returning to the US to Evanston, Illinois, she goes to public school for the first time.Cady struggles to fit in on her first day at North Shore High, returning home humiliated. The next day, she is befriended by loners Janis Ian and Damian Leigh. They suggest she avoid the elite clique the "Plastics": insecure Gretchen Wieners, dimwitted Karen Smith, and "queen bee" Regina George, Janis' nemesis. But, when Cady is invited to sit with the Plastics at lunch, they see it as a way to get revenge on Regina so they persuade her to infiltrate them. Cady is attracted to Aaron Samuels, a senior in her math class, but is told he's off-limits being Regina's ex. Before she can talk to him, Kevin from the Mathletes, meets her and math teacher Ms. Norbury suggests Cady join the team. She accepts, but is later dissuaded by the Plastics. At Regina's mansion, the Plastics show her the "Burn Book", full of negative rumors about students and faculty. When Regina hears Cady has a crush on Aaron, she offers to help. After weeks of trying to get his attention, he invites Cady to a Halloween party. When she arrives, Regina kisses Aaron in front of her, resuming their relationship. A devastated Cady tells Janis and Damian about it, as Janis promises Regina will pay, Cady finally commits to her plan. The trio attempt to sabotage Regina's appearance by replacing her facial moisturizer with foot cream and cutting up her clothes, but it backfires. Regina tells Cady she and Janis were best friends in middle school, until she publically accused Janis of being a lesbian. When Regina tells Cady that she receives candy canes for Christmas every year, Cady and crew turn Gretchen against her, making it seem as though she has been excluded. Then, after their Winter Talent Show performance, Regina insults Gretchen, causing her meltdown. She subsequently tells Cady many of Regina's secrets, including her affair with Shane Oman. After Christmas, Cady and crew unsuccessfully try to get Aaron to catch Regina cheating. Cady tricks Regina into eating nutrition bars, as if they would help her lose weight. To get closer to Aaron, Cady fails math so he can tutor her. At his house, they share a kiss but he pulls away because of Regina. Cady lets Regina's infidelity slip out, so Aaron breaks up with her. After confiding in Gretchen and Karen over it, Regina quickly moves on with Shane.</p>
      <p class="content__img-card__text--box-2">Regina, Gretchen, Cady and Janis are nominated for Spring Fling Queen, although Damian gets Janis nominated through fake votes. When Ms. Norbury tells Cady she is failing math, she lets out her frustrations by calling her a drug dealer in the Burn Book.The Plastics turn on one another, culminating in Regina calling Karen a whore. The next morning, Regina goes to school in sweatpants due to her nutrition bar weight gain. She is kicked out of the Plastics and Cady replaces her as "queen bee". Cady tells her parents she is going to Janis' art show, so can't go with them to a Ladysmith Black Mambazo concert. Her father lets her go despite her mother's objections. While they are away, Cady and the Plastics invite Aaron over, but it turns into a rager.At the party, Gretchen reconciles with Jason and Regina confronts Cady for not inviting her. When Cady and Aaron meet in her bedroom, she drunkenly tries to explain her attempts to get close to him, but he rebukes her for becoming Regina. When Regina walks in on them, Cady vomits on him and he leaves. Janis and Damian appear, confronting Cady for lying to them and also accuse her of becoming Regina. When Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, furious, she ends their friendship and drives off. Finding out the nutrition bars are for weight gain, Regina retaliates by putting herself into the Burn Book and showing Principal Duvall. She claims it's Cady, Gretchen and Karen's, as they are the only girls not mentioned in it. Principal Duvall confronts the three over the book, while Regina incites a riot distributing the contents throughout the school.regarding their treatment of each other. Initially Ms. Norbury's idea of having the girls write apology letters works, until Regina insults Janis, prompting her to reveal Cady's involvement with her plan to ruin Regina's life. Enraged, Regina storms, pursued by an apologetic Cady, but is struck by a bus, fracturing her spine. Shunned and grounded, Cady hears the police are investigating the Burn Book, including allegations of Ms. Norbury drug dealing. Cady admits to writing the rumor and gradually returns to her old self. She apologizes to Ms. Norbury, and although forgiven, must join the Mathletes in the state championship.</p>
      <p class="content__img-card__text--box-3">Later that night, Cady's parents seek her out when her mother learns her father let her go out despite being grounded. At the competition, Cady goes up against an unattractive student in a sudden death round. Realizing that mocking her appearance won't stop her from winning and ruining Regina's life didn't make her feel better, Cady wins the tiebreaker and North Shore is the winner. Cady and the Mathletes arrive at the Spring Fling, where Shane is elected king and Cady queen. She apologizes, declaring that all are wonderful in their own way, snapping the plastic tiara and distributing the pieces to other girls in the crowd. After Cady reconciles with Janis and Damian, she dances with Aaron and they start a relationship. Janis and Damian kiss while dancing, only to mutually decide they're better off as friends. Kevin cuts in to dance with her, who he had no chemistry with before, but they connect when Janis reveals she's Lebanese. The Plastics disband at the beginning of the new school year. Regina joins the lacrosse team to positively manage her anger, Karen becomes the school weather reporter, Gretchen joins the "Cool Asians", and Janis and Kevin begin dating. Aaron graduates from high school and enrolls at Northwestern University, so Cady sees him on weekends. Reflecting on the relative social peace that has taken over the school, Damian notices a trio of new "Junior Plastics" in freshman year, and Cady jokingly imagines them being hit by a bus.</p>
