      <p class="content__img-card__text--box-1"><a href="plot.html">Mean Girls</a> Mean Girls is a 2004 American teen comedy film directed by Mark Waters and written by Tina Fey. The film stars Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried (in her film debut), Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, Amy Poehler, and Fey. It is based in part on Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 non-fiction self-help book, Queen Bees and Wannabes, which describes female high school social cliques, school bullying, and the damaging effects they can have on students. Fey also drew from her own experience at Upper Darby High School as an inspiration for some of the concepts in the film. The plot centers on a na√Øve teenage girl navigating her way through the social hierarchy of a modern American high school after years of her parents homeschooling her while conducting research in Africa. </p>
      <p class="content__img-card__text--box-2">Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels produced the film. Fey, screenwriter and co-star of the film, was a long-term cast member and writer for SNL. Although set in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, the film was mostly shot in Toronto. Filming took place from September to November 2003. The film marks Lohan's second collaboration with director Waters, the first being Freaky Friday, released a year earlier. Released on April 30, 2004, the film grossed $130 million worldwide and developed a cult following. Critics praised its direction, screenplay, humor, and performances; especially lauded was Lohan's acting, which earned several accolades including three Teen Choice Awards and three MTV Movie & TV Awards, and in 2021, was listed as the 11th-best performance of the 21st century by The New Yorker.</p>
